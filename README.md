# LoneEFT by Dreadful

Forked from Mambo - I'll update with changes I like from time to time but mainly will pull from Mambo and add the visual colors back in as well as my version of the loot widget. 

## Current Changes

All of Mambo's current features and updates

My version of the Mambo loot widget (Sort by Name or Price using N and P key's on radar PC)

Added visual colors to Color Picker, Loot Filter, and Cham vischeck colors

ESP Ammo Counter is LimeGreen - Can be changed in SKPain.cs

## Future Changes

Loot Widget sort by Distance with D key on radar PC

Any updates Mambo makes
